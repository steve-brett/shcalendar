Formula date manager for Sacred Harp singings

http://www.bristolsacredharp.org/stevetest/

## Issues
* Comment code properly and review
* Review simplicity of functions in singingFormula and interpretFormula classes
* Extend singingFormula::specialDays() to all special days within a week instead of just nearest

## Future plans
* iCalendar output
* multi-day events
* Incorporate fifth Sundays into formulae
